# On libostree systems, /opt is a symlink to /var/opt,
# which actually only exists on the live system. /var is
# a separate mutable, stateful FS that's overlaid onto
# the ostree rootfs. Therefore we need to install it into
# /usr/lib/1Password instead, and dynamically create a
# symbolic link /opt/1Password => /usr/lib/1Password upon
# boot.

ONEPASSWORD_RPM='https://downloads.1password.com/linux/rpm/stable/x86_64/1password-latest.rpm'

# Prepare staging directory
mkdir -p /var/opt # -p just in case it exists
# for some reason...

# Now let's install the package.
rpm-ostree install "${ONEPASSWORD_RPM}"

# And then we do the hacky dance!
mv /var/opt/1Password /usr/lib/1Password # move this over here

# Create a symlink /usr/bin/1password => /opt/1Password/1password
rm /usr/bin/1password
ln -s /opt/1Password/1password /usr/bin/1password

#####
# The following is a bastardization of "after-install.sh"
# which is normally packaged with 1password. You can compare with
# /usr/lib/1Password/after-install.sh if you want to see.

cd /usr/lib/1Password

# chrome-sandbox requires the setuid bit to be specifically set.
# See https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17972
chmod 4755 /usr/lib/1Password/chrome-sandbox

# Normally, after-install.sh would create a group,
# "onepassword", right about now. But if we do that during
# the ostree build it'll disappear from the running system!
# I'm going to work around that by hardcoding GIDs and
# crossing my fingers that nothing else steps on them.
# These numbers _should_ be okay under normal use, but
# if there's a more specific range that I should use here
# please submit a PR!

# Specifically, GID must be > 1000, and absolutely must not
# conflict with any real groups on the deployed system.
# Normal user group GIDs on Fedora are sequential starting
# at 1000, so let's skip ahead and set to something higher.
